# React Virtual Wallet - Watermelon üçâ üí≥

One year after developing the first version with Vanilla JavaScript, I wanted to make that first project even better, now using React. To go beyond Front End, I developed the [backend RESTful API](https://github.com/FranCeballos/watermelon-wallet-back.git) from the ground up to go along with the app. 

## Skills applied

- React v18
- Redux Toolkit Query
- React Router Dom v6
- Framer Motion

## Usage
In case you want to download and run the app locally, first install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then run the app with: 
```
npm start
```

### Special Notes
Right now the backend API runs on a free tier of Render, so the server sleeps after a certain amount of minutes of inactivity. An initial request may take around 30 seconds to get a response.
